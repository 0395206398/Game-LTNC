Vegito in the Prairie

Hello everyone, My name is Duc and this is my first game project using SDL2 and C++. It is a simple endless-running game, based on Google Chrome Dinosaur. This might have many mistakes, but I hope you can enjoy it! Just press Space to jump and dodge the obstacles! That's it! Have fun!
